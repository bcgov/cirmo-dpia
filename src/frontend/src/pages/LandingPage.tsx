            The Government of BC is creating a flagship Digital Privacy Impact
            Assessment (DPIA). This project will leverage service design
            findings to build a novel product that reimages the Privacy Impact
            Assessment (PIA) tools to support streamlined business processes and
            improved user experience.

        <h2>What is a Privacy Impact Assessment</h2>
        <p>
          A PIA is a step-by-step review process to make sure you protect the
          personal information you collect, use or disclose in your project.
          Doing a PIA can help protect privacy and build public trust by being
          clear about what information government is collecting, who has access
          to it, and where and how it’s stored.

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
              The Privacy, Compliance and Training (PCT) is government’s
              corporate privacy office and has the mandate to review all PIAs
              for BC government ministries. PCT has seen a 686% increase in PIAs
              submitted for review in within a 10 year period. While the
              increase in volume is exponential, the statistics do not reflect
              the pressures that result from increased complexity of PIA
              submissions.{' '}

            <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
            <p>
              The DPIA will alleviate unsustainable workload pressures, connect
              siloed information, support innovation, reduce repetition in the
              PIA process and enable compliance with legislated PIA
              requirements.

            <p>
              The DPIA will be an integrated, guided, online tool for the for
              anyone working in a BC ministry that needs to complete a PIA.
              Digitizing the PIA will create a streamlined experience that
              enables a culture of privacy and innovation.{' '}
