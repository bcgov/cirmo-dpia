## Locally running the development app
```bash
$ make api-setup-env
$ make app-run
```

### Docker and Docker Compose

To setup project specific docker containers, first make sure you have Docker Desktop installed on your machine. Next, run the following command.

```bash
docker compose up -d [SPACE SEPARATED LIST OF CONTAINERS]
```
This command will build the project API and Web App containers in headless mode. If you need to only run one container remove "dpia-api dpia-webapp" and replace with
the name of the container you'd like to build and run. The name of all containers used within the DPIA project can be found in the docker-compose file found at the
root level of this repository.
